            <p>
                A calico cat (US English) is a domestic cat of any breed with a tri-color coat. The calico cat is most commonly thought of as being 25% to 75% white with large orange and black patches; however, they may have other colors in their patterns. Sometimes a variation occurs with cream and grey patches that is called a muted calico. Calicoes are almost exclusively female except under rare genetic conditions.

                    <strong>Calico cats are "Good Luck" cats</strong><br>Calico cats are thought to bring good luck in Japan. In past years, Japanese sailors would travel with Calicos onboard their ships for protection. In the U.S. and U.K., male Calico cats have been thought to be especially lucky because they are so rare.

                    <strong>Calico cats are called "Money Cats"</strong><br>Calico cats have been called “Money Cats” in the U.S. because it was thought that they would fetch top dollar when sold. This is actually a myth, since male Calico cats are sterile and not useful to breeders who might be interested in buying them.

                    <strong>Calico cats are called "Beckoning Cats"</strong><br>The maneki-neko or “the beckoning cat” is based on a Calico cat. This Japanese symbol goes back to the 1870s, and statues of it are still placed at the entryways of Japanese homes and business for good luck.
